      <p>To decide this year’s candidates, I decided to look at multiple websites and find common players listed for the top-10 MVP candidates. Once the statistics are laid out, it will start to become clear who fits the description of a potential winner and who does not. Each player will be put up against the trends found from the previous MVPs. The more categories the player fits, the better chance they have at winning MVP. These players below are listed in alphabetical order.</p>

            <p>Out of the ten candidates, five will not be awarded MVP due to the trends found in the winners since 2000.</p>
</div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
      <p><b>Ja Morant:</b> Morant had one of the most remarkable seasons the NBA has seen out of a third-year player. His playmaking (6.7 assists) and scoring volume (27.4 PPG on 49.3 FG%) helped the Grizzlies garner the 2nd seed for the 2022 Western Conference playoffs. However, one statistic immediately disqualifies Morant from contention for the MVP: his availability on the court. Morant only played 57 games, missing time due to injuries in both of his knees on separate occasions. No MVP in the 21st century hasn’t played less than 85% of their available games, let alone below 70%. To add to the fact that he missed too many games, Memphis is 20-5 without their star point guard. If the team is able to win without its best player, that player most likely doesn’t impact winning enough to win the award.
</p>
<br/><br/>

      <p><b>Rudy Gobert:</b> Gobert is widely known as one of the, if not the best defender in the NBA. The France native is a three-time Defensive Player of the Year that is a nightmare for any offensive player once they enter the painted area of the court. His efforts and impacts on defense can not be understated. Though he is dominant on one end of the court, his efforts on the other end lack MVP stature. Over 15 points per game is respectable, as is over shooting 70% from the field (best in the NBA for FG% and TS%), but his middle-of-the-pack 16.9 usage percentage makes him a non-threatening candidate for the award. As already discussed, the MVP is someone who has the ball in their hands and significantly impacts an offense. Gobert, although fantastic on defense, doesn’t have enough offensive firepower to win the award this season.
</p>
<br/><br/>
      <p><b>Trae Young:</b> The point guard led the Atlanta Hawks to the play-in tournament and the playoffs by himself. Young’s elite three-point shooting from every area of the court makes him extremely difficult to guard and his ability to hit floaters in the paint spreads the floor for the Hawks. On top of that, his assist numbers in the 2022 season were phenomenal: Young led the league in assists per game. Although he took a big leap in leadership and production this season, the success of his team is what holds him back. No player in the 21st century has ever won MVP after finishing the year worse than the 6th seed and the fact that Young had to participate in the play-in tournament makes it very difficult for him to win MVP, and it will ultimately be the deciding factor in his case to win the award.
</p>
<br/><br/>
      <p><b>LeBron James:</b> In his 19th season in the NBA, LeBron continued producing at some of the highest levels of his career. At 37 years old, most fans began losing faith that the 4-time champion still had it in him to heavily produce offensively. All of those fans were very, very wrong. James found a new step this season, almost won the scoring title averaging 30.3 points per game and tried his hardest to carry his team to the playoffs. However, the Lakers’ record and LeBron’s availability this season speak for themselves when deciding whether he should win his 5th MVP this season. The Lakers finished as the 11th seed in the Western Conference and sixteen games under .500, which is hard to fathom. On top of that, the star only played 56 games and his health was up in the air for most of the season. Being on a losing team and missing over 30% of the season makes James’ Most Valuable Player campaign near non-existent, whether or not he put up eye-watering numbers.
        <br/> <br/>
</p>
<p><b>Devin Booker:</b> Booker had the best season of his career this year. After helping his team get to the NBA finals in 2020-2021, the guard followed the campaign up with an efficient and effective season. That is not the reason as to why Booker won’t win this award. The MVPs since the 21st century have all been, without argument for the most part, the best player on their team. Unfortunately for Devin Booker, this is not the case for him. Chris Paul, the veteran star point guard for the Suns, shot nearly three percent better from the field, averaged the most assists per game in the entire NBA with 10.8 per game and almost an identical PER rating (21.3 for Booker versus 20.8 for Paul). When you take into account the fact that Paul missed three more games than Booker, and that PER is a cumulative stat, it is unclear whether Devin Booker is the best player on his team. Due to this, he will unfortunately not win the 2022 NBA MVP award when basing it off stats alone.  </p>

      <p>This leaves us with five players left. Each has their own case and will be examined thoroughly. They are ranked from five to one based on the comparison of statistics.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><b>#5 - Jayson Tatum:</b></p>
      <p>	After a slow start to the season, Jayson Tatum helped lead the Boston Celtics from an under .500 team over 40 games into the season to the second seed in the Eastern Conference. The 24 year-old seemed to get better as the second half of the season progressed as Boston continued to climb up the standings. The forward’s star season cemented him as a star in the NBA, and will be a potential All-NBA type player when the playoffs conclude. However, his statistics only bring him so far, landing Tatum at number five on this list. Tatum did not have the efficiency-type of season that Antetokounmpo, Embiid and Jokić had. His 57.8 TS% is impressive, but it does not rival the 60+ TS%’s posted by the three big-men. Additionally, his USG% is on par or lower than those listed above him and, despite only missing 8 games, Tatum failed to have an eye-popping PER statistic. His 21.8 PER is impressive, but it does not come close to the higher values the top four players on this list were able to garner. </p>

  </script>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p><b>#4 - Luka Dončić:</b></p>
<p>	In only his third season, Luka Dončić has already established himself as one of the premier players in all of basketball. Luka single handedly led the Dallas Mavericks to the 4th seed in the Western Conference and, while his teammates remained question marks around him, he consistently performed at the top of his game. Dončić led his team in points (28.4 PPG), rebounds (9.1 R) and assists (8.7 A) per game, showing that he has completely run the offense when available. The star European guard’s placement at fourth on this list is not a knock to his incredible season. His 25.1 PER, 57.1 TS% and 37.4 USG% all rank on the higher end of NBA players, creating an extremely solid resume. As impressive as the guard’s statistics are, Dončić still fails to reach the PER and TS% numbers that were posted by the top three players on the list, as seen from the graph. Luka carried his team offensively and continued to push his team towards the hierarchy of the Western Conference, but it was not enough for him to crack into the top three on the MVP ladder.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
    <center><p><b>#3 - Giannis Antetokounmpo:</b></p></center>
    <p>Giannis has already won two MVPs in his short NBA career, and has a chance to win his third after this season. The powerful scorer, labeled the “Greek Freak”, was on a tear during the 2021-2022 campaign. He not only continued to carry his team throughout the regular season, but he put up statistics close to his recent Most Valuable Player seasons. Giannis shot an extremely impressive high clip from the field (55.3% from the field) and had the ball in his hands enough to directly impact his team’s winning nature (34.9 USG%). On top of that, his 32.1 PER ranks as one of the highest in the NBA this season. His failure to rank higher on this list, based on statistics alone, does not have to do with his personal performances this season, but rather the freak season’s the two centers ranked above him had. Antetokounmpo takes a hit when examining his three-point shooting, which fell below 30% this season, and his availability in only 67 of 82 games. The “Greek Freak” has a shot to win the award this season, but looking solely based off statistics, the 27 year-old falls just short. </p>

        <div class="col-8">
          <center><p><b>#2 - Joel Embiid:</b></p></center>
          <p>Joel Embiid did something during the 2021-2022 NBA season that helped him land second on this list. The Cameroonian became the first center since Shaq to hold the league’s scoring title. Embiid’s 30.6 points per game cemented him as one of the most talented scorers in the NBA from all three levels: from behind the arc (37.1% from three), from the field (just shy of 50%) and from the line (81.4% from free throw). Embiid also had the ball in his hands consistently, posting a 37.2 USG%, the highest out of any center in the NBA. He was able to consistently rebound (11.7 boards per game), was always present on the defensive end (averaged over a steal and block per game) and had a true shooting percentage that exceeded 60 percent (61.6%). His 31.2 PER does not reach the levels of Giannis or the number one player on this list, but his high usage percentage and effectiveness from all three scoring positions gives him the second position. The one knock on Embiid’s case is his games played, as he missed 14 games due to injury and COVID-19 protocols. The 7-footer does not rank one on this list due to his own performance, but rather because of the complete dominance of Nikola Jokić.</p>

              <p>	Nikola Jokić won the 2020-2021 NBA MVP because of his ridiculous statistics at the end of the season. This year, based on his stats, the star center is set up to do the same. The Nugget averaged over 27 points, almost 14 rebounds and almost 8 assists per game. That combination is hard to come by and, when a player posts close to triple-double averages, it is almost never a big man. Jokić’s 31.9 USG% shows he is heavily involved in the offense and his astounding 66.1 True Shooting Percentage represents one of the most efficient seasons in the 21st century. All former MVPs listed in this article had the combination of a few great statistics that elevated their award cases to the next level, and Jokić is no different. The combination of his advanced statistics (PER, TS% and USG%) give the center the edge in the MVP race. On top of that, his Player Efficiency Rating wasn't just the highest in the league at 32.8, it’s the greatest PER in a single season <b>ever</b>. That type of statistical stature is the type of thing that wins a player the MVP award. He led the Nuggets, with almost no help, to the 6th seed with 48 wins and was consistently available, playing 74 of 82 possible games. He was available, consistent and dominant all season. He embodied every trend recent former MVPs exerted and improved on many of them. </p>

              <p>Through statistical analysis, Nikola Jokić should ultimately win the 2022 KIA NBA MVP award. It does not necessarily mean that the center will receive the award though, as there are more things that are taken into account.</p>

              <p>“There are a lot of guys out there who play for bad teams that have garbage time at the end of games and they can run up their points per game, their rebounds and assists,” Riccardi said. “Stats don’t really take up the whole picture. It also doesn’t really account for chemistry things and effort types of things, anything like that.”</p>

              <p>However, at the end of the day, stats tell a large portion of the story. It is hard to ignore Jokić’s dominance, whether or not Embiid and Giannis also posted MVP-caliber campaigns.</p>
