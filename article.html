      <p>Every year, a panel of sportswriters, broadcasters and basketball personalities in the United States and Canada take months watching the NBA season to decide who should win certain awards. These include Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Coach of the Year and the Most Valuable Player. There are always debates surrounding what player wins an award and these arguments are heightened around the Most Valuable Player award. Given to the player who contributes the most to their team’s overall success, it is seen as an accolade that is supposed to be awarded to the best player of the season. However, there is one issue: all of these awards do not have specific stipulations that decide who wins. Every year, debates for MVP are about different stats, situations or instances that went on during the season. Each person has a different reason why their MVP should win, why other people's MVPs should not win and how the award should be given out. </p>
<p>Despite debates, statistics continue to be the driving force that determines the NBA MVP at the end of the season. Nick Riccardi, a Syracuse University Adjunct Professor in Sport Analytics, says that statistics are extremely important when deciding things like sporting awards.</p>
<p>“Statistics give us the opportunity to compare things that, in reality, we are only seeing with our eyes for the most part,” Riccardi said. “It’s very clear when you watch a sport who is good and who is not, and who is making a big impact. When MVP candidates are being compared, who only play each other a few times a year, it is a lot harder to compare players that way. Statistics is a way to beat around the bush in that matter and really compare things.”</p>

      <p>With uncertainty regarding how the MVP is awarded in the NBA, I decided to take a deep dive into the MVP winners of the 21st century, why they won those MVPs and identify trends that could help pinpoint who should win the 2022 KIA NBA MVP award. </p>

      <p>With basketball evolving every year and with there being a heavy emphasis on three-point shooting and specific play-styles, evaluating the twenty-first century NBA MVPs will allow for similar types of players to be compared to this year's candidates. Once it is clear why each player won the prestigious award, it will be clearer who should win this year.</p>

      <p>	After looking at the past twenty-two NBA MVPs, multiple trends jump right out, all of which help narrow down who should win the award this season.
</p>
      <p>Every single one of the players listed above played at least 85% of their team’s games. Availability and consistency on the court is one of the main factors that voters look at when deciding awards. With rest days becoming more and more common in today’s basketball world, many MVP candidates fail to play 85% of possible games. However, playing a majority of games is still very important, and it still proves the difference for some candidates.</p>
      <p>Every single MVP winner in the past 22 years was on a winning team. A player could average the most points in a season, but if their team is not winning, voters and the NBA community generally ignore the athlete’s case for MVP, and for good reason. The award is given to the player that contributes to <b>winning</b> the most, not losing. A winning record and higher seed increases a player's likelihood of being awarded MVP, as seen above. No winner since 2000 has won less than 57% of their 82 games and to go further, no player has ever gotten the accomplishment without being at least the 6th seed. Most MVPs end the season as a 1st, 2nd or 3rd seed. Due to this, multiple candidates for this year’s award will be unable to garner the accomplishment.</p>
      <p>To win MVP, a player has to have the ball in his hands frequently. The more a candidate has the ball, the more they can affect their team’s offensive success. Besides Steve Nash, who played in a specific type of offense that led to quick possessions, every single MVP since 2000 has had a usage percentage (USG%) above 28%. In today’s NBA, the Most Valuable Player must be willing and able to have a significant role on offense. Those candidates that have lower usage percentages will be discounted due to their role and abilities on offense and those with higher usage percentages, with other statistics to back it up, will be credited and looked at as a strong contender for the award.
</p>

    <div class="col-4">
      <iframe title="[Percentage of Games Played - 21st Century NBA MVPs]" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-reYU1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/reYU1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="593"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <p>Basketball is not all about scoring. Being able to pass, rebound, facilitate or defend is also extremely important in the sport. This is seen through the last 22 MVP winners. All winners since 2000 have excelled in an area that does not have to do with scoring or shooting. All centers or forwards listed averaged a high number of assists or rebounds and most guards averaged acceptable or excellent assist numbers. Additionally, almost every single former MVP listed averaged more than one block or steal. The only MVP in the 21st century that debatably does not fit these descriptions is Allen Iverson in 2000-2001, but he was such an elite scorer that he was given the award. Players in 2021-2022 that only excel in one area will be hurt in their case for winning MVP.
</p>
<p>Despite most former MVPs being lethal on the offensive end, defense is still important. As previously stated, almost every single Most Valuable Player since 2000 has averaged either over a steal or block during their respective seasons. Being great at offense is one thing, but being able to affect the defensive end makes a star a superstar. Most of the former MVPs were at least able to bulk up a steal or block a game, so those in this year’s race who struggle to do so will have their case diminished.</p>
<p>Finally, efficiency is key. Every single MVP since 2000 has had a true shooting percentage around fifty-five or higher besides one. That does not necessarily mean that the player has to be a three-dimensional scorer (from two, from three and from free throw) but it does mean that whatever they are good at, they do it effectively and efficiently. A player could be really bad at shooting three-pointers and free throws, like Shaquille O’Neal, but dominant inside the arc. Those who score efficiently from all three levels will see their cases heightened but as long as the candidate is effective at what they do best, the player will be taken into serious consideration when it comes to MVP.
</p>
<p>All of these players were also the best player on their team that season. Any player who is not the most effective player on their particular team will see their case for winning MVP take a hit.
</p>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of why past Most Valuable Players won the award, it’s time to look at the 2022 candidates to find out who best fits the mold to win the 2022 KIA Most Valuable Player award.
